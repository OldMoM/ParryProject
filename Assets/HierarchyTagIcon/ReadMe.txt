Thanks for purchase Hierarchy tag icons from asset store.

Usage: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- After import the package into your unity project you can setup the icons easy:

  - Go to (Top Toolbar) Window -> *Hierarchy Icons
  - In the open window you will see a list with each tag of your project with a few vars in each field
   to set the icon to a tag simply drag the texture to the icon var of tag that you want.
  - if you want change the color of icon you need use a whitte icon for override the main color.

Tips: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If you are using another hierarchy icon editor extension you probably have
  problems with the position of the icons (drawn in the same position), for solved this we include a easy fix
  simply go to (Top Toolbar) Window -> *Hierarchy Icons, in the bottom you will see a slider called "Horizontal Position"
  move this for customize the position of icons in hierarchy.
